  <h2>Character: Isaac</h2>
  <img src="images/isaac.jpg" alt="Isaac Character" style="width: 200px; height: auto;" />
  <p>Isaac is the main character of the game and the first character you play as.</p>
  <p>Isaac's journey is one of self-discovery and overcoming personal demons, which is reflected in the game's dark themes.</p>
  <p>Isaac is a reference to the biblical story of the Binding of Isaac, in which Abraham is commanded by God to sacrifice his only son, Isaac, to prove his loyalty and love.</p>
  <p>Most characters in the game are actually this Isaac sprite with either a wig, a hat, or some other cosmetic change (he canonically has Dissociative Identity Disorder).</p>
  <p>Isaac starts with 3 red heart containers and a bomb.</p>
  <p>After progressing through the game to kill Isaac with ??? (Blue Baby), he permanently receives the D6.</p>
  <p>Speaking of which, Isaac also shows up as a boss on the Cathedral floor!</p>
