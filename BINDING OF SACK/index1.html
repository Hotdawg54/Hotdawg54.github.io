      <h2>About the Game</h2>
      <p>
        The Binding of Isaac is a roguelike dungeon crawler video game created by Edmund McMillen.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was released in 2011 and has since gained a large following due to its unique gameplay, dark themes, and extensive item combinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game has 4 DLCs, with over 700 items, 102 bosses, over 20 different characters, multiple unique endings, and 4 different game modes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game started as a Flash game, which you can play here: <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-binding-of-isaac_202111" target="_blank">The Binding of Isaac (Flash Version)</a>.

      <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
      <p>
        I made this site due to my love and devotion for The Binding of Isaac. I've played this game for over 10 years now. I have played through all the DLCs, modded it, and even played it on my Nintendo 3DS!
      </p>
      <p>
        The roguelike genre of video games is my favorite type of game, but Isaac does the roguelike a little differently than most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the nature of the roguelike, there are items you only see every couple of runs, but what if you could force out your favorite items every time you play?
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite part about games like this is doing game breaks. Using your creativity, thinking, and problem-solving to find the best way to break the game in your current situation is the most fun part of the game. Becoming super overpowered by a combination of luck AND skill is incredibly satisfying.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site will highlight my favorite additions in both Afterbirth and Repentance DLCs, as well as the D6â€”a crucial item for having loads of fun and one of the most overpowered items. I will highlight my favorite ways to break Isaac in each section of the website.
